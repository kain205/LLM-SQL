# üìä LLM SQL Model Test & Report

> This file is used to record test questions and report the results of model evaluation on the violations database. Test on new RAG
>
> **Models being tested:**
> - A: `hf.co/second-state/CodeQwen1.5-7B-Chat-GGUF:Q4_K_M`
> - B: `gemini-flash`
>
> **Quick guide:**
> - Run the pipeline with each question below for both models.
> - For each question, record:
>   - Model A: [SQL | Result | Evaluation]
>   - Model B: [SQL | Result | Evaluation]
> - You can attach the `report.html` link or quote from `logs/results.jsonl`.

   - Model B: OK

7. List the violations from last month.

### 3) Aggregations & Analytics
11. Count the number of violations by department.

12. Which department has the highest rate of "Resolved" violations?
    - Model A: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Model B: OK

13. What is the most common type of violation in "Workshop A"?
    - Model A: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Model B: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Note: There are multiple violation types with the same highest count. Lacks the ability to handle tie cases.

14. Compare the number of violations between "Workshop A" and "Workshop B".
    - Model A: Generated faulty SQL
    - Model B: OK

15. Which area has the most violations?
    - Model A: OK
    - Model B: OK

### 4) Complex Queries
16. Which employee has committed violations in the most different areas?
    - Model A: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Model B: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Note: Similar to question 13, the model cannot handle tie cases.

17. List employees who have committed at least 3 violations and have at least 1 violation "In Progress".
    - Model A: Generated faulty SQL
    - Model B: OK

18. What is the resolution rate of violations for each department?
    - Model A: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Model B: OK

19. Which employees have committed violations in both the office and production areas?
    - Model A: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Model B: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Note: The "office" and "production" areas are not clearly defined. There are multiple interpretations of these terms, so the model cannot handle it.

20. What is the average time from when a violation occurs until it is resolved?
    - Model A: Generated faulty SQL
    - Model B: Correctly answered "no_answer" for cases where the model is uncertain.
    - Note: This data is not available in the database.

### 5) Edge Cases & Special Tests
21. Has anyone committed the same error multiple times?
    - Model A: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Model B: OK

22. List violations that occurred on the weekend.
    - Model A: OK
    - Model B: OK

23. Who is the only person to have violated the "smoking in the workshop" rule?
    - Model A: Generated incorrect SQL
    - Model B: Generated incorrect SQL because it did not capitalize a letter in the query.

24. Are there any departments with no violations?
